Router IP addresses

- Provides connectivity between different IP subnets

- An IP address must be configured on the interfaces in each subnet

    interface FastEthernet 0/0
    ip address 192.168.0.1 255.255.255.0
    no shutdown
    !

    interface FastEthernet 0/1
    ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.0
    no shutdown


Switch Management IP Address

- A layer 2 switch is not IP routing aware

- It does support a single IP address for management

- The IP address and subnet mask is configured on the Switched Virtual Interface (SVI) for the default VLAN 1

- A default gateway also needs to be configured to allow connectivity to other subnets

    interface vlan 1
    ip address 192.168.0.10 255.255.255.0
    no shutdown
    exit
    ip default-gateway 192.168.0.1

The Setup Wizard

    setup          (this brings us to the setup wizard)


Infterface Speed and Duplex

- Interface speed and Duplex is set to 'auto' by default

- Both sides of a link should auto-negotiate to full duplex and the fastest available speed

- Best practice is to manually set the speed and duplex on ports which are connected to another network infrastructure device or server

- It is very important to set matching speed and duplex settings on both sides of the link

    interface FastEthernet 0/1
    duplex full
    speed 100


Verification Commands

    show running-config
    show ip interface brief
    show run interface vlan 1
    show interfae vlan 1
    show version


CDP Cisco Discovery Protocol

- Cisco Discovery Protocol (CDP) is a Cisco proprietary Layer 2 protocol

- It is used to share information with other directly connected Cisco equipment, such as the operating system version and IP address

- This aids in troubleshooting by allowing administrators to map out how Cisco devices are connected to each other

- It is enabled by default on most Cisco equipment

- It works at Layer 2 so it is not necessary for the device to have an IP address

    cdp run
    no cdp run
    Switch(config-if)# no cdp enable      (this is done on interface level in order to allow cdp on other interfaces but limit what is seen by other organizations etc.)
    show cdp
    show cdp neighbors
    show cdp neighbors detail


LLDP Link Lyaer Discovery Protocol

- LLDP is an open standard protocol which provides similar information to CDP

- Differences with CDP:
    - Depending on the switch and version it may be disabled by default
    - It is only supported on physical interfaces
    - It can only discover up to one device per port
    - It can discover Linux servers

    lldp run
    no lldp run
    no lldp transmit
    no lldp receive
    show lldp
    show lldp neighbors
    show lldp neighbors detail


Layer 1 Troubleshooting

- Basic switch troubleshooting involves checking for layer 1 and 2 issues

- Copper and Fibre cables are liable to break if not handled correctly

- Common Layer 1 problems include:
    - The interface is administratively shut down
    - The cable is disconnected on either or both ends
    - The device on the other end of the cable is powered off
    - Broken connectors which cause loose connections
    - Bent or stretched cables which lead to broken wires or fibres
    - Electro-magnetic interference sources such as motors or microwaves which cause errors in transmission (new cable is less susceptible to this)

    show ip interface brief
    - "administratively down" - Issue 'no shutdown'
    - "down/down" - This indicates a Layer 1 issues. Check the interface is cabled at both ends and the device on the other side is powered on
    - "up/down" - This indicates a layer 2 issue or speed mismatch. Check the interface configuration matches on both sides of the link


Speed and Duplex Mismatches

- A possible error is speed and/or duplex mismatches

- Incorrect speed settings can cause the interface to operate below its maximum speed

- Speed mismatches will typically bring the interface down

- The interface will typically stay up with duplex mismatches but performance will be terrible because of collisions

- The show interface command will report an excessively high number of errors in this case.

- Both sides of a link must be set the same, as either auto or manually configured

- Cisco devices default to auto

- Best practice is to manually configure ports attached to other network infrastructure devices or servers
