Layer 3 - The Network layer

- Responsible for routing packets to their destination and for Quality of Service

- IP is the best known layer 3 protocol

- Connectionless protocol with no acknoqledgements at Layer 3

- ICMP and IPSec are other Layer 3 protocols


IP Addressing

- Uses IP addressing to partition the overall network into subnets

- Improves performance and security and makes troubleshooting easier

- Layer 2 MAC addresses use on big flat addressing scheme. There is no logical separation between networks at Layer 2


IP Header

- 4-bit version 
- Header length
- Type of service
- 16 bit ID
- 8 bit protocol (TCP/UDP)
- 8-bit time to live (ttl)
- 16-bit header checksum
- 32-bit source IP address
- 32-bit destination IP address
- Header options
- Data


Unicast, Broadcast and Multicast Traffic

- Unicast = single host

- Broadcast = all hosts on the subnet
    - Routers do not forward broadcast traffic

- Multicast = multiple interested hosts



Counting in Binary

- 0 or 1

- For each column in a number we have two choices, 0 or 1

- everytime we add a column to the left, the value is multiplied by 2

- 236 = 11101100

- 179 = 010110011


IPv4 Addresses

- 32 bits long
- Written as 4 octets in dotted decimal format
- 192.168.10.15
- Each octet is 8 bits long (4 x 8 = 32)

Static vs Automatic Addressing

- IP address is usually set manually on servers, printers and network devices such as routers and switches. 
it is usually assigned automatically through the Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) on Desktop computers



IPv4 Address Octets

- Each octet in the IP address has a value ranging from 0 to 255

- 128 64 32 16 8 4 2 1 = 255

- 192.168.10.15 = 11000000.10101000.00001010.00001111

- To set a boundary between logical networks (subnets), the IP address is combined with a subnet mask


The Subnet Mask

- A host can send traffic directly to another host on the same subnet via switches

- For a host to send traffic to another host in a different subnet, it must be forwarded by a router

- Host needs to understand if the destination is on the same or a different subnet in order to know how to send it

- Subnet mask is used for this

- Subnet mask is 32 bits long, and can be written in dotted decimal or slash notation


Network and Host Portion

- Host's IP address is divided into a network portion and a host portion

- Subnet mask defines where the boundary is

- 192.168.10.15 255.255.255.0  
    - Write IP address out in binary notation (11000000.10101000.00001010.00001111)
    - Write subnet mask in binary underneath  (11111111.11111111.11111111.00000000)
    - IP address is compared ('masked') with the subnet mask
    - A '1' in the subnet mask indicates that bit in the IP address is part of the network address
    - A '0' indicates the bit is part of the host address
    - SUbnet mask always begins with contiguous '1's

- HOst portion of address is available to be allocated to end hosts on the network


Host Addresses

- Host portion of the address specifies the individual host and must be unique on that subnet

- Hosts do not have to be numbered sequentially

- If the network portion of the address is 10.10.10, you can have a host with IP address 10.10.10.10 and 10.10.10.20

- You cannot have two different hosts both with IP address 10.10.10.10


The Network Address (Network ID)

- All 0's in the host portion designates the network address and is not allowed to be allocated to a host

- In our example the network address is 192.168.10.0


The Broadcast Address

- All 1's designates the directed broadcast address for the subnet

- Traffic with this destination address will be sent to all hosts in the subnet

- In our example the broadcast address is 192.168.10.255

- This leaves 192.168.10.1 to 192.168.10.254 to be allocated to other hosts


Subnet Mask in Slash notation

- 255.255.0.0 = /16
- 255.255.255.255 = /32
- 255.255.255.0 = /24
- 255.255.248.0 = /21
