CIDR Classless Inter-Domain Routing

- Problem with classful addresses was that if a company had more than 254 hosts they would need to be assigned a Class B network

- They would have much less than 65,534 hosts allocated, so this wasted a huge amount of the global address space

- Companies can now be allocated an address range which more closely matches their needs and does not waste addresses Example: 175.10.10.0/20


Route Summarisation Benefits

- ISP A does not know about all 256 /24 networks reachable in ISP B

- It only has the single 175.11.0.0/16 summary route

- This reduces the size of ISP A's routing table and takes up less memory

- If an individual link goes down in ISP B, it has no impact on ISP A. The single summary route does not change

- Routers in ISP B would have to recalculate their routing table if a link went down

- This restricts issues to the local part of the network and reduces CPU load


Subnetting

- Rather than purchasing separate address ranges for the different departments, we can purchase a single range and subnet it into smaller portions


Borrowing Host Bits

- Let's say we've been allocated Class C 200.15.10.0/24

- To subnet the network into smaller subnets, we need to borrow host bits and add them to the network portion of the address

- The network address line always moves to the right when we subnet

- The further to the right we go, the more subnets we'll have of that size but less hosts


Calculating the Number of networks

- To calculate the number of available subnets, the formula is 2 subnet-bits)

- If a Class C network uses a /28 subnet mask then we've borrowed 4 bits from the default of /24

- 2^4 = 16 available subnets

- If a Class B network uses a /28 subnet mask then we've borrowed 12 bits from the default of /16

- 2^12 = 4096 available subnets

- Hosts on different subnets need to go via a router if they want to communicate with each other


Calculating the Number of Hosts

- To calculate the number of available hosts, the formula is 2^host-bits - 2

- We subtract 2 because the network address and broadcast address cannot be assigned to hosts

- If a class C network uses a /28 subnet mask then we have 4 bits left for hosts

- 2^4 - 2 = 14

- If a class B network uses a /28 subnet mask then we have 4 bits left for hosts 

- 2^4-2 = 14


Class C/31 Subnet

- Class C 200.15.10.0/24

11001000.00001111.00001010.00000000 (200.15.10.0)
11111111.11111111.11111111.11111110 (255.255.255.254)

- This leaves one bit for the host address, with a possible value of 0 or 1

- It borrows 7 bits for the network address

- This gives us 128 subnets (2^7) which accomdate 2 hosts each

- We subnet using the /31. Valid host addresses :
  - 200.15.10.0 to 200.15.10.1
  - 200.15.10.2 to 200.15.10.3
  - ETC. to 200.15.10.254 to 200.15.10.255

- What about the network and broadcast address?!

- /31 subnets are supported on Cisco routers for point to point links (which have no need for a network or broadcast address)


Class C /30 Subnet

- Allocated Class C 200.15.10.0 /24

- Now using /30 255.255.255.252

- Leaves 2 bits for the host address, 2^2 = 4, minus 2 for the network and broadcast address = 2 possible hosts

- It borrows 6 bits for the network address

- This gives us 64 subnets (2^6) which accomodates 2 hosts each

- Valid host addresses: Goes up in values of 4. Line is after the 4 so it goes up by 4
  200.15.10.1 to 200.15.10.2  (network .0, broadcast .3)
  200.15.10.5 to 200.15.10.6  (network .4, broadcast .7)
  200.15.10.9 to 200.15.10.10 (network .8, broadcast .11)
  all the way to 200.15.10.253 to 200.15.10.254 (network .252, broadcast .255)


/31 vs /30

- Both accomodate 2 hosts per subnet

- /31 supports 128 subnets and /30 supports 64

- /31 is useful to maximize use of your address spae

- /30 is more standard and commonly used

- FOR EXAM, USE /30 WHEN A SUBNET SUPPORTS 2 HOSTS UNLESS TOLD TO USE /31


Variable Length Subnet Masks VLSM

- Early routing protocols only supported Fixed length subnet masking (FLSM) where all subnets had to be the same size. 
You could not have a subnet with 14 hosts and another subnet with 64 hosts in the same network

- All modern routing protocols support VLSM which allows us to size subnets differently according to how many hosts they have


Subnetting Considerations

- How many locations do we have in the network

- How many hosts are in each location

- What are the IP addressing requirements for each location (Should different departments or types of host be in different subnets)

- What size is appropriate for each subnet (Don't waste addresses, but leave room for growth)


Subnetting Design Steps

- Find the largest segment and allocate a suitable subnet size for it

- Allocate this subnet at the start of the address space

- Continue going down the list

- In the real world you want a scalable design - you will likely allocate spare subnets for future growth, and leave
space in the subnets for additional hosts

- In the CCNA exam do exactly what the question asks, don't worry about whether it best practice or not


Subnetting Large Networks

- Class B 135.15.0.0/16

- 135.15.10.138/29
    - Magic number method
    - Subnet mask = 255.255.255.248
    - Subtract value in the subnetted octet from 256: 256-248 = 8
    - The network address goes up in multiples of 8
    - Netwok address  = 135.15.10.136


Subnetting Question Categories

- Given a network requirement of 'x' amount of subnets and 'y' amount of hosts per subnet,
what network address and subnet mask should be used for each subnet

- Given a particular IP address and subnet mask, calculate:
  The subnet's network address
  The broadcast address
  The range of valid host IP addresses
