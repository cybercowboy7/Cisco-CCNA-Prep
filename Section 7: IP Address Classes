Subnet Size

- Bigger the host portion of the network, the more hosts we can have

- If subnet mask = /8, we have 24 bits available to allocate to hosts


How Internet Addressing was meant to work

- Private IP addresses with NAT (Network Address Translation) are currently deployed in the majority of enterprise networks as a workaround

- All hosts which can communicate are meant to have a public IP address


Class A Addresses

- Class A addresses are assigned to networks with a very large number of hosts

- The high order bit in a class A address is always set to zero (128 is set to 0)

- The default subnet mask is /8

- Valid network addresses range from 1.0.0.0 to 126.0.0.0/8

- This allows for 126 networks and 16,777,214 hosts per network


Reserved Class A addresses

- 0.0.0.0/8 is reserved and signifies 'this network'

- 0.0.0.1 to 0.255.255.255 are not valid host addresses

- 127.0.0.0/8 in the Class A space is reserved as the loopback address for testing local computer

- 127.0.0.1 to 127.255.255.255 are not valid host addresses

- wiped out 35,554,428 address from global address pool


Subnetting

- Company would not put all 16,777,214 hosts into a single logical network

- They would split the /8 address allocation into smaller subnets and allocate these to different offices and types of hosts

- Example: if they received 15.0.0.0/8, they could allocate the subnet 15.0.1.0/24 to sales computer in NY, 
15.0.2.0/24 to accounting PCs and 15.0.9.0/24 to sales computers in boston

- This is called subnetting


Class B Addresses

- Assigned to medium-sized to large-sized networks

- The two high order bits in a class B address are always set to binary 10. 

- The default subnet mask is /16

- Valid network addresses range from 128.0.0.0 to 191.255.0.0/16

- This allows for 16,384 networks and 65,534 hosts per network

- This would also be subetted in the real world environment

- 131.192.0.0/16


Class C Addresses

- These are used for small networks

- The three high order bits in a class C address are always set to binary 110

- The default subnet mask is /24

- Valid network addresses range from 192.0.0.0 to 233.255.255.0/24

- This allows for 2,0987,152 networks and 254 hosts per network

- 195.0.192.0/24


PRIVATE ADDRESSES

- Range of reserved private addresses in each class

- Valid to be assigned to hosts but they are not routable on the public internet

- Originally designed for hosts in a closed private network with not internet connectivity

- Class A: 10.0.0.0 to 10.255.255.255

- Class B: 172.16.0.0 to 172.31.255.255

- Class C: 192.168.0.0 to 192.168.255.255


Class D

- Reserved for IP multicast addresses

- The four high order bits in a class D are always set to binary 1110

- These addresses are not allocated to hosts and there is no default subnet mask

- Valid addresses range from 224.0.0.0 to 239.255.255.255

- 227.1.192.5


Class E

- experimental and reserved for future use

- High order bits in a class E address are set to 1111

- These addresses are not allocated to hosts and there is no default subnet mask

- Addresses range from 240.0.0.0 to 255.255.255.255

- 255.255.255.255 is the broadcast address for 'this network'

- 243.1.192.10
