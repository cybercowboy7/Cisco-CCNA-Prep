Layer 1 - The physical Layer

- OSI Layer 1 conveys the bit stream - the electrical impulse, light or radio signals - through the network at the electrical and mechanical level

- It provides the hardward means of sending and receiving data, including defining cables, interface cards and physical aspects


Layer 1 Connection Types for Ethernet - UTP

- Ethernet LAN connections can be carried over twisted copper pair cable, fiber cabel or wireless

- Copper UTP (Unshielded twisted pair) cables are commonly used to connect desktop computers to switches

- Connector type is RJ-45 and maximum lenght is 100 meters


Straight-Through vs Crossover UTP Cables

- The receive and transmit wires in a UTP cable can be wired to the RJ-45 connector as either straight through or crossover

- Straight-through cables are used to connect an end device such as a PC or router to a switch

- Crossover cables are used to connect devices together directly. They are most often used to connect two devices of the same
type: two computers or two switches to each other

- Modern switches support Auto MDI-X where the receive and transmit signals are reconfigured to yield the expected results


Fiber Cables

- Fiber optic cables can be used to support longer distances or higher bandwidth requirements

- For example between separate buildings in a campus, or for switch to switch connections inside a building


Single Mode vs Multi Mode Fiber

- Single mode supports higher bandwidth and longer distances but it is more expensive


PoE Power over Ethernet

- PoE switch allows the added power over ethernet cable rather then using separate power supplies per VOIP phones etc.

- Power Injectors are used to send power over ethernet to the wireless access point (up to 100m)
