Dynamic Routing Protocols

  - When a routing protocol is used, routers automatically advertise their best paths to known networks to each other

  - Routers use information to determine their own best path to the known destinations

  - When the state of the network changes, such as a link going down or a new subnet being added, the routers update each other

  - Routers will automatically calculate a new best path and update the routing table if the network changes
