Dynamic Routing Protocols

  - When a routing protocol is used, routers automatically advertise their best paths to known networks to each other

  - Routers use information to determine their own best path to the known destinations

  - When the state of the network changes, such as a link going down or a new subnet being added, the routers update each other

  - Routers will automatically calculate a new best path and update the routing table if the network changes


Summary Routes

  - Summary routes lead to less memory usage in routers as their routing tables contain less routes

  - They also lead to less CPU usage as changes in the network only affect other routers in the same area

  - For example, if the link on R1 to the 10.0.1.1/24 network goes down, R2 will lose its route there and try to compute a new path

  - R3 will not be affected as its summary route to 10.0.0.0/16 is unchanged


Dynamic Routing protocols vs Static Routes

  - Routing protocols are more scalable than administrator defined static routes

  - Using purely static routes is only feasible for very small environments


Dynamic Routing Protocol Advantages

  - The routers automatically advertise available subnets to each other without the administrator having to manually enter route on every router

  - If a subnet is added or removed routers will automatically discover that and update their routing tables

  - If the best path to a subnet goes down routers automatically discover that and will calculate a new best path if one is available
