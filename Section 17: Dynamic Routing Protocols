Dynamic Routing Protocols

  - When a routing protocol is used, routers automatically advertise their best paths to known networks to each other

  - Routers use information to determine their own best path to the known destinations

  - When the state of the network changes, such as a link going down or a new subnet being added, the routers update each other

  - Routers will automatically calculate a new best path and update the routing table if the network changes


Summary Routes

  - Summary routes lead to less memory usage in routers as their routing tables contain less routes

  - They also lead to less CPU usage as changes in the network only affect other routers in the same area

  - For example, if the link on R1 to the 10.0.1.1/24 network goes down, R2 will lose its route there and try to compute a new path

  - R3 will not be affected as its summary route to 10.0.0.0/16 is unchanged


Dynamic Routing protocols vs Static Routes

  - Routing protocols are more scalable than administrator defined static routes

  - Using purely static routes is only feasible for very small environments


Dynamic Routing Protocol Advantages

  - The routers automatically advertise available subnets to each other without the administrator having to manually enter route on every router

  - If a subnet is added or removed routers will automatically discover that and update their routing tables

  - If the best path to a subnet goes down routers automatically discover that and will calculate a new best path if one is available


Dynamic Routing Protocols vs Static Routes

  - Using a combination of a dynamic routing protocol and static routes is very common in real world environments

  - In this case the routing protocol will be used to carry the bulk of the network information

  - Static routes can also be used on an as needed basis. For example for backup purposes or for a static route to the Internet (Which will typically be injected into the dynamic routing
protocol and advertised to the rest of the routers)


Routing Protocol Types

  - Routing protocols can be split into two main types

      - Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)
      - Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)

  - IGPs are used for routing within an organization

  - EGPs are used for routing between organizations over the internet

  - The only EGP in use today is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)


IGPs

  - IGPs can be split into two main types:
      - Distance vector routing protocols
      - Link state routing protocols


Distance Vector Routing Protocols

  - Each router sends its directly connected neighbors a list of all its known networks along with its own distance to each of those networks

  - Do not advertise the entire network topology

  - A router only knows its directly connected neighbors and the lists of networks those neighbors have advertised. It doesn't have detailed topology information beyond its directly connected neighbors.

  - Often called "Routing by rumour"


Link State Routing Protocols

  - Each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbors
