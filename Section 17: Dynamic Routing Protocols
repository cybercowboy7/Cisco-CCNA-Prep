Dynamic Routing Protocols

  - When a routing protocol is used, routers automatically advertise their best paths to known networks to each other

  - Routers use information to determine their own best path to the known destinations

  - When the state of the network changes, such as a link going down or a new subnet being added, the routers update each other

  - Routers will automatically calculate a new best path and update the routing table if the network changes


Summary Routes

  - Summary routes lead to less memory usage in routers as their routing tables contain less routes

  - They also lead to less CPU usage as changes in the network only affect other routers in the same area

  - For example, if the link on R1 to the 10.0.1.1/24 network goes down, R2 will lose its route there and try to compute a new path

  - R3 will not be affected as its summary route to 10.0.0.0/16 is unchanged


Dynamic Routing protocols vs Static Routes

  - Routing protocols are more scalable than administrator defined static routes

  - Using purely static routes is only feasible for very small environments


Dynamic Routing Protocol Advantages

  - The routers automatically advertise available subnets to each other without the administrator having to manually enter route on every router

  - If a subnet is added or removed routers will automatically discover that and update their routing tables

  - If the best path to a subnet goes down routers automatically discover that and will calculate a new best path if one is available


Dynamic Routing Protocols vs Static Routes

  - Using a combination of a dynamic routing protocol and static routes is very common in real world environments

  - In this case the routing protocol will be used to carry the bulk of the network information

  - Static routes can also be used on an as needed basis. For example for backup purposes or for a static route to the Internet (Which will typically be injected into the dynamic routing
protocol and advertised to the rest of the routers)


Routing Protocol Types

  - Routing protocols can be split into two main types

      - Interior Gateway Protocols (IGPs)
      - Exterior Gateway Protocols (EGPs)

  - IGPs are used for routing within an organization

  - EGPs are used for routing between organizations over the internet

  - The only EGP in use today is BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)


IGPs

  - IGPs can be split into two main types:
      - Distance vector routing protocols
      - Link state routing protocols


Distance Vector Routing Protocols

  - Each router sends its directly connected neighbors a list of all its known networks along with its own distance to each of those networks

  - Do not advertise the entire network topology

  - A router only knows its directly connected neighbors and the lists of networks those neighbors have advertised. It doesn't have detailed topology information beyond its directly connected neighbors.

  - Often called "Routing by rumour"


Link State Routing Protocols

  - Each router describes itself and its interfaces to its directly connected neighbors

  - This information is passed unchanged from one router to another

  - Every router learns the full picture of the network including every router, its interfaces and what they connect to

                                               - IS-IS (Intermediate System-Intermediate System)
Advanced:
- EIGRP (Enhanced Interior Gateway Protcol)



Interior Gateway Protocols

  - All of the IGPs do the same job, which is to advertise routes within an organization and determine the best path or paths

  - An organization will typically pick one of the IGPs

  - If an organization has multiple IGPs in effect (for example because of a merger), information can be redistributed between them. This
should generally be avoided if possible


Routing Protocol Metrics

  - A router may receive multiple possible paths to get to a destination network

  - Only the best path will make it into the routing table and be used

  - The different IGPs use different methods to calculate the best path to a destination network

  - Each possible path will be assigned a metric value by the routing protocol which indicates how preferred the path is

  - The lowest metric value is preferred 

  - Distance Vector routers advertise to each other the networks they know about, and their metric to get to each of them

  - Link State Routers advertise all the links in their area of the network to each other

  - Each router will take this information and then make an independent calculation of its own best path to get to each destination

  - If the best path to a destination is lost (for example because a link went down) it will be removed from the routing table and replaced with the next best route


RIP Metric - Hop Count

  - RIP uses Hop Count as the metric

  - The maximum hop count by default is 15. Paths which are more than 15 hops away are marked as unreachable.

  - Path R4>5>1 will be preferred for 10.0.1.0/24 in the example


OSPF Metric - Cost

  - OSPF uses 'Cost' as the metric, which is automatically derived from interface bandwidth by default

  - You can manually configure the cost of links if you want to manipulate the paths


IS-IS Metric - Cost

  - Also uses Cost as the metric, but it is not automatically derived from interface bandwidth. All links have an equal cost by default

  - You can manually configure the cost of links if you want to manipulate the path

  - If you do not manually set the link costs then the path with the lowest hop count will be used


EIGRP Metric

  - Uses the bandwidth and delay of links to calculate the metric

  - Load and reliability can also be considered but are ignored by default

  - A fixed delay value is used based on the interface bandwidth, the protocol does not dynamically measure current delay

  - You can manually configure the delay on links if you want to manipulate the path


Choosing a Routing Protocol

  - RIP uses hop count and has a default maximum metric of 15. It is not usually used in production networks because of its scalability limitations

  - EIGRP is very simple to maintain, calculates changes very quickly and its metric calculation will normally choose the best path by default. It is typically only supported on Cisco routers however

  - OSPF's metric calculation will typically choose the best path by default. It is an open standard which is supported by all vendor's routers and is the most commonly deployed IGP today. It is however complicated to maintain than EIGRP

  - IS-IS links need to be manually configured or it will use hop count to determine the best path. It is typically only used in Service Provider networks or large organizations with their own MPLS network who choose it because of its scalability.


Equal Cost Multi Path (ECMP)

  - If multiple paths to a destination have an equal metric, the router will enter all of the paths into the routing table

  - Equal Cost Multi Path will load balance the outbound traffic to the destination over the different paths

  - All IGP routing protocolsl will perform ECMP by default

  - EIGRP is the only routing protocol which is capable of UnEqual Cost Multi Path. It must be manually configured to support this


Metric

  - A router will typically only learn routes to a particular destination from a single routing protocol

  - When multiple routes to a destination are learned through a routing protocol, the router will install the path or paths with the best (lowest) metric into the routing table

  - Different routing protocols use different methods to calculate the metric


Administrative Distance

  - If paths to the same destination are received from different routing protocols, their metrics cannot be compared

  - For example, a RIP hop count of 5 cannot be compared to an OSPF cost of 60. The comparison would be meaningless because the routing protocols calculate the metric in completely different ways

  - The router must use a different method to choose when routes to the same destination are received from different routing protocols

  - The admin distance (AD) is used for this

  - The AD is a measure of how trusted the routing protocol is

  - If routes to the same destination are received via different routing protocols, the protocol with the lowest (best) AD wins 

      Route of source              Default AD
Connected Interface                    0
Static Route                           1
External BGP                          20
EIGRP                                 90
OSPF                                 110
IS-IS                                115
RIP                                  120

  - AD is used to choose between multiple paths learned via different routing protocols

  - Metric is used to choose between multiple paths learned via the same protocol 

  - The AD is considered first to narrow the choice down to the single best routing protocol

  - The metric is then considered to choose the best path or paths which make it into the routing table


AD Example

  - A router receives multiple routes to the 10.10.10.0/24 network from both OSPF and RIP

  - When paths to the same destination are received from multiple routing protocols, the AD is considered first

  - OSPF has a better AD than RIP so the RIP routes will be discarded

  - The router will then compare the routes received via OSPF and install the one with the lowest cost in the routing table

  - If multiple equal cost paths are received via OSPF they will all be installed in the routing table and the router will load balance outbound traffic to the destination between them


Floating Static Routes

  - If the best path to a destination is lost it will be removed from the routing table and replaced with the next best route

  - We might want to configure a static route as a backup for the route learned via a routing protocol

  - A problem is that static routes have a default AD of 1 which will always be preferred over the routes learned via an IGP

  - To fix this we can manually give it a higher AD than the preferred route

      ip route 10.0.1.0 255.255.255.0 10.1.3.2 115


Loopback Interfaces

  - Loopback interfaces are logical interfaces

  - They allow you to assign an IP address to a router or L3 switch, which is not tied to a physical interface

  - Because they do not have any physical attributes which can fail, loopback interfaces never go down

  - Loopbacks are logical so they cannot be physically in the same subnet as other devices, so they are assigned a /32 subnet mask to avoid wasting IP address

  - Best practice to assign a loopback interface to your routers

  - Commonly used for traffic that ternminates on the router itself

  - This could be management traffic, VOIP, BGP peering etc

  - This provides redundancy if there are multiple paths to the router

  - Also used to identify the router (Router ID) in OSPF

      interface loopback 0
      ip address 192.168.1.1 255.255.255.255


Adjacencies

  - IGP routing protocols are configured under Global config mode and then enabled on individual interfaces

  - When the routing protocol is enabled on an interface the router will look for other devices on the link which are also running the routing protocol

  - The router does this by sending out and listening for hello packets

  - When a matching peer is found, the routers form an adjacency with each other

  - They then exchange routing information

  - Modern routing protocols use multicast for the hello packets

  - This is more efficient than broadcast which was used by earlier protocols

  - Only routers which are running the same routing protocol will process the packet


Passive Interfaces

  - Passive interfaces allow you to include an IP subnet in the routing protocol without sending updates out of the interface

  - Best practice to configure loopback interfaces as passive interfaces

  - It is impossible to form an adjacency on a loopback interface because they are not physical interfaces

  - Making the loopback passive means that it will be advertised by the routing protocol but it will not waste resources sending out and listening for hello packets


Route Precedence

  - A router's main job is to forward packets received towards their desination, based on the packet's destination IP address

  - It decides where to forward a packet based on the routes it has learned

  - The best route for a packet decision is based on:

      - Longest prefix (most specific)

      - AD

      - Metric
