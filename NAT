No seamless migration path from IPv4 to IPv6

- NAT was implemented to workaround this issue

- Organization can use private IP addresses on their inside network, but still grant
their hosts internet access by translating them to their outside public IP address

- Many hosts on the inside can share a few or a single public IP address on the 
outside
