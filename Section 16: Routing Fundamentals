Router Functions

  - Router has two main functions
    - Determining the best path to available networks
    - Forwarding traffic to those networks


The Routing Table

  - The best available path or paths to a destination network are listed in a router's routing table and will be used for forwarding traffic

  - A routing table consists of directly connected networks and routes configured statically by the administrator or dynamically learned through 
a routing protocol.


Connected and Local Routes

  - The admin configures IP addresses on the router's interfaces

      show ip route

  - This will automatically enter connected routes into the routing table

  - From IOS 15, local routes will also be added to the routing table

  - Local routes always have a /32 mask and show the IP address configured on the interface


Static Routes

  - If a router receives traffic for a network which it is not directly attached to, it needs to know how to get there in order to forward the traffic

  - An administrator can manually add a static route to the destination, or the router can learn it via a routing protocol

      ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.0.2           this adds a static route to the routing table


Summary Routes

  - For static routing, summary routes lessen administrative overhead and memory usage on the routers
      ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.0.2

  - To summarize the range 10.1.0.0 to 10.1.3.0:
      ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.252.0 10.0.0.2


Longest Prefix Match

  - When there are overlapping routes, the longest prefix will be selected
      ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.0.2
      ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.3.2


Load Balancing

  - When multiple equal length routes are added for the same destination, the router will add them all to the routing table and load balance between them
      ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.0.2
      ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.3.2


Default Route (Gateway of Last Resort)

  - ip route 10.1.0.0 255.255.0.0 10.0.0.2
  - ip route 10.1.3.0 255.255.255.0 10.0.3.2

  - ip route 0.0.0.0 0.0.0.0 203.0.113.2
