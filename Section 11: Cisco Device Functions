Hubs and switches

- End hosts in a LAN such as PCs, servers and printers plug into them with an EThernet cable

- The end hosts can then communicate with each other through the hub or switch


Hubs - Half duplex and Shared collision domain

- Hubs operate in half-duplex mode

- Hosts cannot send and receive data at the same time, they can only do one or the other

- All hosts share the same collision domain - only one device can transmit at a time

- If two hosts send at teh same time a collision will occur

- Hosts use Carrier-Sense Multiple Access with Collision Detection (CSMA/CD) to detect collisions and resend


Switches - full duplex and separate collision domains

- Can operate in either full or half duplex

- They always operate in full duplex

- Hosts can send and receive data at the same time

- All hosts have their own dedicated collision domains

- Collision detection is not required


Hubs operate at Layer 1

- They are not MAC aware

- Whenever a frame is received it is flooded out all ports apart form the one it was received on

- All attached hosts must process all packets


Switches operate at layer 2

- MAC address aware

- Switch will look at source MAC address in the layer 2 header

- Learned MAC address will be added to the switche's MAC address table, which maps MAC addresses to ports

- If a unicast frame is later received with a known MAC address as the destinatino, the switch will send the frame out only the relevant port

- Better performance and security

- Whenever a frame is received for the broadcast address or an unknown unicast destination (because the switch hasn't learned the MAC address
yet) it will be flooded out all ports apart from the one it was received on


Routers

- Routers know the paths to get to the different IP subnets on a network

- They are required to send traffic from one subnet to another

- Operate at Layers 3, 2 and 1 and will typically have awareness up to layer 7


Switches vs Routers

- Switches are Layer 2 aware and can switch traffic between hosts on the LAN

- Routers are Layer 3 aware and can switch traffic between different networks

- Switches typically only support Ethernet interfaces

- Switches will typically only support Ethernet interfaces

- Switches will typically have more ports than routers

- Switches forward broadcast traffic, routers do not by default


Layer 3 Switches

- Advanced swithces are layer 3 aware and can route traffic between different IP subnets

- Layer 3 switches will typically support only Ethernet interfaces and will have more ports than routers
