The Domain Name System

- Network Layer Protocol

- DNS resolves a FQDN such as www.cisco.com to an IP address

- Enterprises will typically have an internal DNS server which can resolve the IP addresses of internal hosts

- Hosts will send their DNS queries to this server

- If the DNS server cannot resolve the query, it will forward the request out to public DNS servers on the internet

- DNS requests are sent using UDP port 53 (can fail over to TCP)
