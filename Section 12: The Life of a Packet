The Domain Name System

- Network Layer Protocol

- DNS resolves a FQDN such as www.cisco.com to an IP address

- Enterprises will typically have an internal DNS server which can resolve the IP addresses of internal hosts

- Hosts will send their DNS queries to this server

- If the DNS server cannot resolve the query, it will forward the request out to public DNS servers on the internet

- DNS requests are sent using UDP port 53 (can fail over to TCP)


Address Resolution Protocol (ARP): IP to MAC Address Resolution

- ARP operates at layer 2

- Sender needs to know the receiver's IP address and MAC address to form the packet it's going to send

- We can point the sender directly at the destination IP address or at a user friendly FQDN such as www.cisco.com

- DNS Domain Name System maintains a mapping of FQDNs to IP addresses

- ARP is used to map the IP address to MAC address

- Sender will send a ARP broadcast request looking for x.x.x.x in order to find the MAC address of the receiver


Routed Traffic

- When the sender and receiver are on different IP subnets, the traffic must be forwarded by a router

- Send ARP request for default gateway

- Default gateway will send its MAC address back to sender

- Sender will now send traffic to destination IP on other network with the MAC address of the default gateway

- Router will then send ARP request for destination IP to get its MAC address
