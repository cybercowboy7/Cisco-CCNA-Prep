The Data Link Layer

- Frames are encoded and decoded into bits at Layer 2

- Error detection and correction for the physical layer can be provided here

- Ethernet is the Layer 2 medium used on Local Area Networks

- Layer 2 Protocols:
    - ARP 
    - CDP (Cisco Discovery Protocol)
    - L2TP
    - Link Layer Discovery Protocol
    - PPP (Point to Point Protocol)


Ethernet Header

- Preamble
- Destination Address
- Source Address
- Length/Ethertype
- Data
- FCS (Frame check sequence)


Media Access Control MAC Address

- Ethernet uuses a 48-bit hexadecimal MAC address

- First 24 bits is the OUI (Organizationally Unique Identifier) which uniquely identifies the manufacturer
of the Ethernet port. The OUI is assigned by the IEEE

- The last 24 bits is vendor assigned

- The burned in MAC address on every NIC port in the world is globally unique

- Example: 00:50:56:C0:00:08


How to get information on the MAC address

- ipconfig /all (windows)

- ifconfig (linux and MAC)
