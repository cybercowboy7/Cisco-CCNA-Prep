Network Characteristics:
- Topology
- Speed
- Cost
- Security
- Availability
- Scalability
- Reliability


OSI Model: Open Systems Interconnect Model
- How computer communicate with one another
- Seven layer approach. A layer servers the layer above it and is served by the layer below it. Encapsulates and then De-encapsulates packets
  
  - Layer 7: Application
    - Provides network services to the applications of the user
    - Does not provide services to any other OSI layer
    - Establishes availability of intended communication partners and synchronizes and establishes agreement
    on procedures for error recovery and control of data integrity

  - Layer 6: Presentation
    - Ensures information that is sent at teh application layer of one system is readable by the application
    of another system.
    - Can translate among different data formats using a common format

  - Layer 5: Session
    - Establishes, manages and terminates sessions between two communicating hosts
    - Manages two hosts data exchange

  - Layer 4: Transport
    - TCP/UDP, Port
    - Defines services to segment, transfer, and reassemble the data for individual communications between the end devices
    - Breaks down large files into smaller segments that are less likely to incur transmission problems
    - More reliable versus faster

  - Layer 3: Network 
    - IP address, Routers
    - Source and destination IP address
    - Provides connectivity and path selection between two host systems that may be located on geographically separated networks
    - Provides logical addressing (IP addresses)

  - Layer 2: Data Link
    - Ethernet MAC Address, Switches
    - Source and destination layer 2 addresses
    - Defines how data is formatted for transmission and how access to physical media is controlled
    - Includes error detection and correction to ensure a reliable delivery of the data

  - Layer 1: Physical
    - Hubs
    - Enables bit transmission between end devices
    - Defines specifications for activating, maintaining, and deactivating the physical link between end devices


TCP/IP Stacks
- This is a protocol stack which consists of multiple protocols including TCP and IP
- OSI Model is conceptual while the TCP/IP stack is used to transfer data in production networks
- Only 4 layers
- Layer 4: Application 
    - Consists of Applications, Presentation and Session layers
    - Represents data users, encodes and controls the dialog
    - Data Protocol data units
- Layer 3: Transport
    - Supports communication between end devices across a divers network
    - Segment Protocol Data Units
- Layer 2: Internet
    - Provides logical addressing and determines the best path through the network
    - Packet Protocol Data Units
- Layer 1: Network Access
    - Controls the hardware devices and media that make up the network
    - Frame Protocol Data Units
