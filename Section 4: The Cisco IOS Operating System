Cisco Operating Systems

- Cisco Nexus and MDS data center switch product lines run on NX-OS

- IOS-XR operating system runs on the servie provider NCS, CRS, ASR9000 and XR12000 series routers

- IOS-XE runs on the ASR1000 series service provider routers

- The CLI for the other OS are nearly identical to IOS


Connecting to a Cisco Device over the Network

- Real world scenarios you would utilize Putty to connect to a real router or switch over the network

- To get to the CLI you will use SSH over IP address

- Telnet is another protocol to get to the CLI but it is not encrypted

- Secure login will be enforced through integration with a centralized Authentication, Authorization and Accounting Server

- There will usually be a separate management network to connect to devices experiencing issues
  - Known as Out of Band Management
  - In band is if you utilize production environment network to manage devices


Initial Connection to Cisco Device

- Cisco devices do not usually have a default IP address, so we need to set one up before we can connect to it over the network

- You will need to utilize a console connection to get to the cisco CLI in order to assign an IP address to access it via the internet
  - Console cable = DB9 to RJ45
  - Can get a serial DB9 to USB in order to go from laptop to DB9 to RJ45 to the switch or router
  - They have new cables with USB to Mini-USB to better support

- Plug cable into the console port in order to manage the device

- Can also utilize console port in order to view the device booting up from a console connection but this is not possible with SSH
because the system must have booted already before the IP address will be live

- Brand New Router Commands:

    - no to startup config
    - Yes to autoconfigure
    - This brings us to user exec prompt (Router>)
    - If you type ? this will bring up a series of commands that can be used within this level of access
    - Hitting enter key will allow it to who more and more commands
    - To improve amount of scrollback you can right click putty icon in top left corner and click settings to edit the lines of scrollback to 2000
    - enable (en) command gets us to privelege exec mode (Router#)
    - disable command will bring us down a level to user exec mode
    - show command allows us to get information about the device
      - Can use sh *space* ? in order to see all the possible options for the show command and any other commands
    - sh aaa ? will allow you to see all show aaa commands you can utilize as well
    - Tab completion is also supported for the CLI
    - debug is a great command as well to see real-time information such as live packets etc
    - at enable prompt hit configure terminal or conf t in order to configure your router. This bring us to global configuration (Router(config)#)

    - In global config mode
      - hostname Router1 can allow you to change the name of the router to Router1
      - Ctrl A can get you to the start of your command line
    - Interface configuration level you hit interface fastethernet 0/0 (or whatever int you want) to get to interface level  
    - To get out you hit exit to go down one level
    - To get to the lowest level you can use end command or Ctrl C
    - show ip interface brief and show run config are very popular commands in order to get information on your router configs and interface runtimes


Cisco IOS Configuration Management

  - config t
  - hostname Router1
    - Change takes effect immediately and goes into running config. Does not go into startup config
  - In order to put into startup config, you need to use the command copy run start (in priv exec mode)
  - Can manually copy running config to flash
    - copy run flash:my-config
  - sh flash to verify backup
  - Can restore from backup if need be
    - erase startup
    - copy flash:my-config start
  - Not good to backup device to same device
    - Copy running config to tftp server
    - copy run tftp
    - IP of tftp server
    - name of filename
    - Backs up config on server
  - How to view config file in flash
    - more flash:my-config

  - IOS operating system is stored in Flash  
  - Startup config is stored in NVRAM
  - Running config is stored in RAM (Loaded into RAM from the startup config when the device boots up)
